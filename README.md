# Augusto Min Kyu Lee | Full Stack & Machine Learning

## About Me
I'm an ambitious fullstack developer with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven applications that solve real-world problems. My portfolio showcases a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, with particular expertise in Node.js, React, and AI integration. I thrive on challenging projects that push the boundaries of modern web development‚Äîfrom building custom HTTP servers from scratch to implementing machine learning systems and real-time data streaming.
What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and practical web applications. Whether it's implementing semantic search with vector embeddings, integrating LLMs for personalized recommendations, or developing computer vision systems, I bring a unique combination of AI literacy and solid software engineering fundamentals. I'm driven by curiosity, constantly learning new technologies, and committed to writing clean, maintainable code that scales.

File System Operations: Advanced fs/promises usage, automated document generation with PDFKit

## Database & Data Management

Data Modeling: Transaction management, secure data storage, and efficient query patterns
File-based Systems: JSON data handling, async file operations, and data persistence strategies

## AI & Machine Learning Integration

LLM Integration: Experience with Google Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures
Vector Embeddings: Semantic search implementation using embedding-based similarity matching
Computer Vision: Trained custom YOLOv5 models achieving 90%+ precision for object detection
Reinforcement Learning: Built training pipelines with PPO algorithms and 1M+ training steps

## Additional Technical Competencies

API Integration: Third-party service integration and data pipeline construction
Performance Optimization: Stream processing, efficient algorithms, and resource management
Security: Input validation, sanitization, and secure application design
Modern Web Standards: Progressive enhancement, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility
